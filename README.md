**Review Questions**
Contains the Answers to the 6 Review Questions files during the course
* `RQ1`: Distributed Systems
* `RQ2`: Hadoop Map&Reduce, Spark
* `RQ3`: Spark - SparkSQL
* `RQ4`: Kafka - Flink
* `RQ5`: SparkStreaming
* `RQ6`: Graphs Frameworks

**Labs**
* `lab1`: Hadoop, Spark, SparkSQL
* `lab2`: SparkStreaming, Kafka, Cassandra, GraphX

**Project: SparkStreaming application for Online monitoring**
For the Final Project we chose the development of a full stack Streaming Application. The aim is to read incoming data (location, timestamp etc.) from dockless vehicles, process and visualize them in a map to understand which are the most frequented/most demanding areas in a city. 

**Frameworks/Tools**
* `Kafka`
* `SparkStreaming`
* `ElasticSearch`
* `Kibana BI Tool`
