# Data Intensive Computing (ID2221) course at KTH.

This course requires the fulfilling of two Laboratories, several Review Questions regarding the studied topics, two Research raper Reviews and a Final Project.

For the Final Project we chose the development of a full stack Streaming Application. The aim is to read incoming data (location, timestamp etc.) from dockless vehicles, process and visualize them in a map to understand which are the most frequented/most demanding areas. 

The pipeline of frameworks/tools used to fulfil our task is composed by:

-Kafka

-Spark Streaming

-ElasticSearch

-Kibana
